# AutoBill: AI-Powered Autonomous Checkout System

### Overview
AutoBill is an AI-powered autonomous checkout system designed to revolutionize the shopping experience in retail stores. Using a combination of computer vision, RFID/NFC sensors, and advanced machine learning algorithms, AutoBill provides a seamless, cashier-less shopping experience. As customers pick items, the system tracks them in real-time, adds them to a virtual cart, and automatically processes the payment when they leave the storeâ€”completely eliminating the need for traditional checkout lines.

### Key Features
- AI-Powered Virtual Cart: Automatically adds or removes items from the cart when customers pick up or put them back on the shelves.
- Seamless Checkout: Payments are processed automatically as customers exit the store, eliminating the need for manual checkout.
- Real-time Inventory Management: Keeps track of store inventory in real-time and alerts for restocking needs.
- Customer Behavior Insights: Provides valuable analytics and insights on customer behavior and purchasing patterns.
- Facial Recognition/Account Linking: Optional customer identification using facial recognition or linked store apps for a personalized experience.
  
### Technology Stack
- Computer Vision: OpenCV, TensorFlow for real-time object detection and tracking.
- Machine Learning: LSTM, CNN models for item recognition and pattern prediction.
- RFID/NFC Sensors: Used for tracking items and enabling automatic billing.
- Cloud Integration: AWS/Google Cloud/Azure for backend data storage and model execution.
- Payment Gateway Integration: Integrated with digital wallets like Apple Pay, Google Pay, and store-specific payment systems.
